# Anvil

This is a proof of concept Acme client/server written in Elixir for easier integration
in distributed environments like Docker. Browse the source code for ideas - but there 
are no tests, no guarantees, and it's not complete. APIs are most certainly going to
change, and it may not even work at all. User beware.
